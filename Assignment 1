Week 1 Assignment

Question 1: Write a Python program to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
Solution 1:

# First enter the numbers that you want to perform actions with
a= int(input("Enter the first number: "))
b= int(input("Enter the second number: "))

# Then we perform the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operation on the given numbers by the user.
print("Addition of two numbers: ",a+b)
print("Subtraction of two numbers: ",a-b)
print("Multiplication of two numbers: ",a*b)
print("Division of two numbers: ",a/b)

Question 2: Create a program that uses conditional statements to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
Solution 2:

# First enter the number that you want to check
a= int(input("Enter the number: "))

# Then we use if-elif-else conditions to check weather the number is positive, negative or 0.
if a>0:
    print("The number is positive")
elif a<0:
    print("The number is negative")
else:
    print("The number is zero")

Question 3: Write a script that accepts user input and displays it in reverse order.
Solution 3:

a= input("Enter the script: ")
b= ""
i= len(a)
while i>0:
    b= b+a[i-1]
    i= i-1
print(b)
